## Data Preprocessing

Effective data preprocessing is fundamental to the success of any NLP project. The following steps were meticulously executed to prepare the data for model training:

### Cleaning Steps

1. **Removal of Irrelevant Columns**:
   - Dropped columns that do not contribute to the summarization task (e.g., `id`).

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Ensured there are no missing entries in the `article` and `summary` columns. Entries with missing data were either removed or imputed.

3. **Text Normalization**:
   - Corrected common misspellings and standardized terminology across the dataset.

**Output:**
```
Dropped 'id' column.
Handled missing values in 'article' and 'summary' columns.
Performed text normalization.
```

### Text Preprocessing

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Split text into tokens (words, punctuation) for easier processing.

2. **Lowercasing**:
   - Converted all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.

3. **Stop Words Removal**:
   - Eliminated common stop words that do not contribute meaningful information to the summarization task.

4. **Punctuation Removal**:
   - Removed unnecessary punctuation to reduce noise.

5. **Lemmatization**:
   - Reduced words to their base or root form to ensure uniformity.

6. **Handling Rare Words**:
   - Removed or replaced rare words that may not contribute significantly to the model's understanding.

**Example:**

- **Original Article**:  
  "In recent news, the stock market has seen significant volatility due to geopolitical tensions."

- **Preprocessed Article**:  
  "recent news stock market seen significant volatility geopolitical tensions"

**Output:**
```
Tokenization completed.
Converted text to lowercase.
Removed stop words.
Eliminated punctuation.
Performed lemmatization.
Handled rare words.
```
